# Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages

In this second post of our series, I'll show you how to set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages. This will enable continuous deployment whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Why Automated Deployment?

Automated deployment eliminates manual deployment steps, reduces human error, and ensures your blog is always up-to-date with your latest changes. With GitHub Actions, every push to your main branch will automatically trigger a build and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up automated deployment, you'll need:

1. A GitHub repository with your Next.js project
2. A Cloudflare account
3. Your project already configured with OpenNext (from the previous post)

## Step 1: Set Up Cloudflare Pages

### Create a Cloudflare Pages Project

1. Log into your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to **Pages** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create a project**
4. Choose **Connect to Git**
5. Select your GitHub repository
6. Configure the build settings:
   - **Framework preset**: None
   - **Build command**: `npm run ci:build`
   - **Build output directory**: `out`
   - **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)

### Get Cloudflare Credentials

You'll need two pieces of information from Cloudflare:

1. **Account ID**: Found in your Cloudflare dashboard sidebar
2. **API Token**: Create a custom token with Pages deployment permissions

## Step 2: Create GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token

## Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
        uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: next-blog
          directory: out
          gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Step 4: Configure Build Output

Ensure your `next.config.ts` is configured for static export:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## Step 5: Test the Deployment

1. Commit and push your changes to the main branch
2. Go to your GitHub repository's **Actions** tab
3. You should see the deployment workflow running
4. Check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for deployment status

## Step 6: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Custom domains**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS settings as instructed

## Understanding the Workflow

### Trigger Conditions
- **Push to main**: Deploys production changes
- **Pull requests**: Tests builds without deploying

### Build Process
1. **Checkout**: Gets the latest code
2. **Node.js Setup**: Installs Node.js 18
3. **Dependencies**: Installs npm packages
4. **Build**: Creates production build
5. **Deploy**: Uploads to Cloudflare Pages

### Environment Variables
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Authenticates with Cloudflare
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Identifies your account
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Provided automatically by GitHub

## Monitoring Deployments

### GitHub Actions
- View deployment status in the **Actions** tab
- Check build logs for any errors
- Monitor deployment times

### Cloudflare Pages
- View deployment history in the Pages dashboard
- Check for any build errors
. Monitor performance metrics

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
1. **Dependency Issues**: Check `package-lock.json` is committed
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fix type errors before pushing
3. **Memory Issues**: Consider using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`

### Deployment Failures
1. **API Token Issues**: Verify token has correct permissions
2. **Account ID**: Double-check the account ID format
3. **Project Name**: Ensure project name matches Cloudflare Pages

### Performance Issues
1. **Build Time**: Optimize dependencies and build process
2. **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize your JavaScript bundles
3. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component appropriately

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Builds

You can create different workflows for different environments:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Similar steps but deploy to staging environment
```

### Conditional Deployments

Only deploy on specific file changes:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'package.json'
      - 'next.config.ts'
```

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Automated**: No manual deployment steps required
2. **Reliable**: Consistent deployment process
3. **Fast**: Cloudflare's global CDN ensures fast loading
4. **Secure**: HTTPS enabled by default
5. **Scalable**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
